		<h1>Puzzle Palace - Chapter 2</h1>
		<div>
			<p>You step cautiously into the dark corridors of Puzzle Palace. The air is cool and damp, with the faint sound of dripping water echoing through the hallways. Ahead of you, the path splits into three directions, each one shrouded in mystery and anticipation.</p>
			<p>On the left, you hear the distant sound of mechanical gears turning. Straight ahead, a soft glow illuminates the walls with an eerie, green light. To the right, a cold draft sends shivers down your spine, hinting at hidden dangers.</p>
			<p>What do you choose to do next?</p>
